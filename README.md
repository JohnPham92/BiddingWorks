# BiddingWorks

Housingworks is a non-profit in based in NYC that fights AIDS and homelessness. They run a series of thrift shops which often have great items up for thrifting.
I created a web scraper that will periodically notify me of the items. 

The service uses BS4 to scrape the data and then the free version of SendGrid to email me the results. It currently runs at 8 am, 12 pm, 8 pm on the day when an auction is about to complete.
